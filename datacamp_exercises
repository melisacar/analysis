-JOINING DATA in SQL
--1
SELECT * 
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code ;

--2
-- Select name fields (with alias) and region 
SELECT cities.name as city, countries.name as country, region
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code ;


--3
-- Select fields with aliases
SELECT c.code AS country_code, name, year, inflation_rate
FROM countries AS c
-- Join to economies (alias e)
INNER JOIN economies AS e
-- Match on code field using table aliases
    ON c.code = e.code ;



--4 Multiple INNER JOINS

SELECT name, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code
-- Add an additional joining condition such that you are also joining on year
	AND e.year = p.year ;


--5
--INNER JOIN
SELECT

--Same with LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
