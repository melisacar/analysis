In this introductory project, you are interested in the recent carbon emissions of each industry in product_emissions and decide to look at carbon emissions by different industries from the most recent year within the database.

In the first SQL cell, find the most recent year that data on carbon emissions was collected.
In the second SQL cell, write a query that returns a table of each industry_group along with the number of companies that are in that industry and a total of the PCFs for that industry, rounded to one decimal place, filtering for the most recent year that data was collected.
Please name the three columns industry_group, num_companies, and total_industry_footprint.
Present your results in order from the highest emitting industries to the lowest emitting industries.

-- Find the most recent date
SELECT MAX(year)

-- Complete the query
SELECT 
	industry_group, 
	COUNT(*) AS count_industry,
	ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf),1) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
WHERE year = 2017
GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;
